# OSD600 Lab 2 - Cornell Notetaking App
A web based note taking app based on the Cornell method of note taking. I used [this](https://grid.layoutit.com  "this") site to create the layout.

### Possible additional features
- a download feature to convert the page into a printable PDF 
- spell check functionality

### Future fixes
- Fixing inconsistencies in underlining for the text [![](https://i.imgur.com/sTeybaO.png)](https://i.imgur.com/sTeybaO.png)
- If there is too much text in one section, it will expand into the next section. Using 'overflow:auto' didn't fix this issue.
